                First I would like to describe why <b>this</b> even exists and who needs it.
                It seems to me that many people have a wrong understanding of "blogging".
                Blogs aren't for other people to read or listen to, but for the author.
                In particular, they help you structure your thoughts more carefully and even if you can't write a post, you can get a better understanding of an issue.
                Also writing posts helps to improve your language skills and not only, because you have to check every word like a sheep and you're always wondering: "Is there a comma in there?".
                Also, the blog is a kind of obligation, because you constantly need to supplement it with posts (at least once in a while), it develops discipline.
            </p>
            <p>
                It isn't a fact that after these pathological words the blog (site) will not die, but I will try to supplement it with all sorts of things. Otherwise, feel free to check out my <a href="https://t.me/valleyinkentucky" target="blank_">Telegram channel</a> or my projects on GitHub.

                You're probably wondering what untalented dumbass wrote that piece of cringe above. That's me!
